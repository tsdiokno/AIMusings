# AIMusings
A collection of articles and musings-like content prompted, framed, and pondered by me â€” summed up with the help of AI.

I had always wanted a place where I can compile all of the end-of-discussion summaries that I have with AI engines. I think of AI as thinking buddies with whom I can bounce off ideas until they turn in to something cohesive and something that I can go back to or share to people.


## The Process

I usually start with an idea or a prompt. It could be a way of thinking about things, or maybe an idea that I'd like to explore deeper.

I'd spend a considerable amount of time asking questions, debating, contemplating, doing my own traditional Google search, reflecting on many things. There are many times that these would take multiple days. Sometimes I leave the AI chat for a while and revisit it if something more cohesive comes to my mind.

I'd consider content that's "ripe" or ready to share if I'm able to personally resonate with the AI's output; if it says things the way I would say it, the way I'd think about it, and so on. It's by this time that I call the musing or the article "cooked". I wind down the conversation and keep them here.

I revise these articles as needed, thinking of it as a living and breathing personal thought diary about anything that I could think of. Of course I don't see this as a replacement to human-to-human conversations. I also don't pretend that these thoughts are novel or that they're something that hasn't yet been exhaustively discussed elsewhere.

At best this is just to help me organize my thoughts, and on the other end it's how I have fun, an outlet where I get to appreciate how far technology has come with AI in helping humanity think of things better -- hopefully!
